## Hi there 👋 I'm DreamBinary

#### 🧑‍💻 I'm a current Master's student in the MAC Lab at XMU. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at FZU and had internships at AgiBot and DeepWisdom.

#### 📱 I used to enjoy mobile development and have developed several Android or iOS apps using native development or the Flutter framework. Therefore, I am proficient in Kotlin, Swift, Dart, and other programming languages used for mobile development.

#### 🌐 Now I mainly focus on research in deep learning and machine learning, especially in multimodal and natural language processing, and I am currently working hard to learn.

#### 💓 About hobbies, there are too many. I like 👟running, 🏓table tennis, 🏸badminton, 🎾tennis, and I am currently learning 🛹skateboarding. In addition to these sports, I also like 📺watching dramas, 🎵singing, 🎨painting, and 📹photography.
